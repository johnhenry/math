/**
 * CellGraph — a reactive, pull-based dependency graph. Cells hold typed
 * values (numbers, points, curves, whatever) rather than flattened
 * primitives; a derived cell's `compute` reads other cells via `graph.get`,
 * and the graph records the resulting edges automatically (no manual tag
 * declarations, unlike mcp-query's cache).
 *
 * Writes (`set`) mark transitive dependents dirty and bump their version
 * counters immediately — cheap, no recompute. Recomputation happens lazily,
 * the next time a dirty cell is `get`, and a structural-equality check skips
 * the version bump (and further propagation) when a recompute produces a
 * value that's deep-equal to what was already cached, so unaffected
 * downstream consumers don't re-render.
 *
 * Promoted here from johnhenry/mallory-graph (originally `src/lib/cell-
 * graph.ts`, powering every panel there via `useCell`/`useSyncExternalStore`)
 * once johnhenry/mallory-grapher became a second consumer of a frozen
 * vendored copy — two consumers is this monorepo's own extract-to-a-package
 * trigger. See johnhenry/mallory#56. UI-framework-agnostic and dependency-
 * free by design: nothing here references React or any host application.
